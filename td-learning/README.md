# morris-water-maze
A Python implementation of the actor-critic model as presented in [Foster, Morris and Dayan (2000)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/(SICI)1098-1063(2000)10:1%3C1::AID-HIPO1%3E3.0.CO;2-1). Demonstrates computationally how hippocampal place cells may be used for navigation. Navigation is simulated as a virtual Morris Water Maze task.
